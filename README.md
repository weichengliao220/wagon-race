Hello, my name is Brian Liao. Welcome to my GitHub!

I recently graduated from Le Wagon Tokyo's Web Development Coding Bootcamp (Batch #1808) and am currently seeking a junior web developer position.

The Le Wagon vs Porsche 911 Race game was a challenge completed during the Le Wagon Tokyo's Web Development Bootcamp.

This simple game allows users to race by using their keyboard - Press 'Q' to move the Le Wagon and 'P' to move the Porsche 911.

The Le Wagon vs Porsche 911 Race is currently hosted and live on Render: https://wagon-race.onrender.com

Thank you!
